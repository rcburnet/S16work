pair_sami_alfalfa.py is a script for looking at SAMI txt file and any ALFALFA csv file and prints out the closest pairs between the two surveys and their distances in arcseconds.

SAMI_EarlyDataRelease.txt is the txt file for the SAMI survey targets.

a40.datafile1.csv is the csv file for the a.40 ALFALFA survey targets.

a70_160624.csv is the csv file for the a.70 ALFALFA survey targets. This txt file has the closest target pairings at 7 targets being below 0.09 arcseconds of distance and the two coordinates lying on the same target in SIMBAD (not the case for the other ALFALFA csv files).

alfalfa.gridsa_160317.csv is the csv file for the a.100 ALFALFA survey targets over the lowest velocity quadrant (cz < 3200 km/s) only.

collapse_cube_complete.py is a script to create the Halpha image for each of the 7 SAMI sources and plot their spectra. Must be run in ~/SAMI/data (where the reduced and calibrated SAMI datacubes are)
