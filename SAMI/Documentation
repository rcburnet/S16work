pair_sami_alfalfa.py is a script for looking at SAMI txt file and any ALFALFA csv file and prints out the closest pairs between the two surveys and their distances in arcseconds.

SAMI_EarlyDataRelease.txt is the txt file for the SAMI survey targets.

a40.datafile1.csv is the csv file for the a.40 ALFALFA survey targets.

a70_160624.csv is the csv file for the a.70 ALFALFA survey targets. This txt file has the closest target pairings at 7 targets being below 0.09 arcseconds of distance and the two coordinates lying on the same target in SIMBAD (not the case for the other ALFALFA csv files).

alfalfa.gridsa_160317.csv is the csv file for the a.100 ALFALFA survey targets over the lowest velocity quadrant (cz < 3200 km/s) only.

collapse_cube_Halpha_complete.py is a script to create the Halpha image for each of the 7 SAMI sources and plot their spectra, saving the fits images and pdf plots in the working directory.

collapse_cube_continuum_complete.py is a script to create the continuum flux image (between Halpha + 7Ang and NII_2 - 7Ang) for each of the 7 SAMI sources and plot their spectra, saving the fits images and pdf plots in the working directory.

SDSS_data_retrieval_request.csv is a csv file that contains the coordinates (RA, DEC) of the 7 SAMI sources to be used to retrieve the SDSS data. Pasted to the site: http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/search/IQS.asp to output the following csv file for data retrieval.

SDSS_data_retrieval_request_result.csv is the output CSV file from http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/search/IQS.asp to be uploaded to http://das.sdss.org/www/html/post_fields.html to retrieve SDSS data (found in ~/SAMI/SDSS_data/) . See http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/tutorials/retrieveFITS.html for a tutorial on how to retrieve SDSS data.

./continuum_images/ contains the images of the continuum flux of the 7 SAMI sources. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/data/continuum/ .

./Halpha_images/ contains the Halpha images of the 7 SAMI sources. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/data/Halpha/ .

./SDSS_images/ contains the rband SDSS images of the 7 sources, oriented the same as the SAMI data and includes a green circle that encloses the approximate size and location of the SAMI data. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/SDSS_data/ .
