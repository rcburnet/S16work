pair_sami_alfalfa.py is a script for looking at SAMI txt file and any ALFALFA csv file and prints out the closest pairs between the two surveys and their distances in arcseconds.

SAMI_EarlyDataRelease.txt is the txt file for the SAMI survey targets.

a40.datafile1.csv is the csv file for the a.40 ALFALFA survey targets.

a70_160624.csv is the csv file for the a.70 ALFALFA survey targets. This txt file has the closest target pairings at 7 targets being below 0.09 arcseconds of distance and the two coordinates lying on the same target in SIMBAD (not the case for the other ALFALFA csv files).

alfalfa.gridsa_160317.csv is the csv file for the a.100 ALFALFA survey targets over the lowest velocity quadrant (cz < 3200 km/s) only.

collapse_cube_Halpha_complete.py is a script to create the Halpha image for each of the 7 SAMI sources and plot their spectra, saving the fits images and pdf plots in the working directory.

collapse_cube_continuum_complete.py is a script to create the continuum flux image (between Halpha + 7Ang and NII_2 - 7Ang) for each of the 7 SAMI sources and plot their spectra, saving the fits images and pdf plots in the working directory.

collapse_cube_Halpha_calculated_50_percent_velocity_widths.py is a script that calculates the FWHM velocity dispersion (50% velocity width?) of the Halpha line profile from the SAMI data. Originally thought could be used for 50% velocity widths in /HI_gas_mass_upper_limits/HI_gas_mass_upper_limits_using_50_percent_completeness_limit.py instead of the average 50% velocity width of the a.70 catalog to calculate upper limits to HI gas mass, but Balogh said that is not the case.

SDSS_data_retrieval_request.csv is a csv file that contains the coordinates (RA, DEC) of the 7 SAMI sources to be used to retrieve the SDSS data. Pasted to the site: http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/search/IQS.asp to output the following csv file for data retrieval.

SDSS_data_retrieval_request_result.csv is the output CSV file from http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/search/IQS.asp to be uploaded to http://das.sdss.org/www/html/post_fields.html to retrieve SDSS data (found in ~/SAMI/SDSS_data/) . See http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/tutorials/retrieveFITS.html for a tutorial on how to retrieve SDSS data.

./continuum_images/ contains the images of the continuum flux of the 7 SAMI sources. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/data/continuum/ .

./Halpha_images/ contains the Halpha images of the 7 SAMI sources. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/data/Halpha/ .

./SDSS_images/ contains the rband SDSS images of the 7 sources, oriented the same as the SAMI data and includes a green circle that encloses the approximate size and location of the SAMI data. They are screenshots of the fits files in ~/SAMI/SDSS_data/ .

./Halpha_to_SFR/ contains the scripts for converting Halpha to SFR using the relation in the Kennicutt 1998 (K98) article of the 7 SAMI targets that have HI detections as well as calculates the SFR to HI gas mass ratios. It also contains scripts that converts Halpfa to SFR of the 58 SAMI targets in the ALFALFA survey area that have no HI detections and calculates the SFR/HI gas mass ratio of those targets using their upper limits of the HI gas mass and plots SFR/HI gas mass vs Mstar for all 65 targets and SFR vs HI gas mass.

./HI_gas_mass_upper_limits/ contains scripts for calculating the upper limits to the HI gas mass of the 65 SAMI targets that are within the ALFALFA survey area. Two methods are employed. The correct method is used in the script HI_gas_mass_upper_limits_using_50_percent_completeness_limit.py .
